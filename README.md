# Trip Planner
### Description
Trip Planner is a react/google maps based web app that finds the users current location and allows the user to drop several markers/pins down. Once a few markers are down it becomes possible to find the best route between the markers.

### TODO:

[] make history button show the history (CONSIDER having history also hold the best route to take if one was found)
[] tests
[] store history to the browser using localStorage for continuous history
[] undo button
